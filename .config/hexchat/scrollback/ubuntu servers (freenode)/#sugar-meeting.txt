T 1544216504 24<walterbender24>24	We are entering the last week of GCI
T 1544216517 24<walterbender24>24	It has been really busy from the start
T 1544216547 29<2125callaurrea29>	great
T 1544216554 29<2125ifeanyi_29>	I'm here
T 1544216567 24<walterbender24>24	more than 500 students are participating
T 1544216589 24<Quozl24>24	i think the quantity and quality of coding is substantially down from last year, and i think that is reflection of the number of mentors who haven't made comprehensive contributions.
T 1544216614 24<Quozl24>24	but then, i'm only measuring pull requests and commits.  not the stuff that generates nothing.
T 1544216643 24<walterbender24>24	I think is it less about mentoring and more about the tasks we made available
T 1544216647 29<2125MrBIOS29>	is there a comprehensive list of GCI tasks that have been worked on and completed, outside of the GCI web UI?
T 1544216658 29<2125MrBIOS29>	it seems there is a transparency problem on that front
T 1544216670 24<walterbender24>24	That is a structural problem.
T 1544216690 24<walterbender24>24	Not sure how to fix it
T 1544216705 24<Quozl24>24	MrBIOS: as it is a competition, there is a private group that has access, and limited review of task definitions.  the more people who have access, the greater risk of solutions being sold in advance to students.
T 1544216719 24<walterbender24>24	But I didn't get much input from devel when making the initial task list before the contest began
T 1544216738 29<2125MrBIOS29>	I understand.
T 1544216740 29<2125amaan_iqbal929>	Its also a problem
T 1544216741 29<2125callaurrea29>	hmmm
T 1544216766 29<2125MrBIOS29>	when does GCI wrap up?
T 1544216773 24<walterbender24>24	One week
T 1544216794 29<2125amaan_iqbal929>	Around 5 days
T 1544216814 29<2125callaurrea29>	It would be good to organize the tasks in different buckets and see if we have data that support the most successful ones
T 1544216815 24<walterbender24>24	The bottom line, somewhat correlated with Quozl 's observation, is that the areas where there are active mentors get the most attention.
T 1544216826 24<walterbender24>24	Lots of work done on Music Blocks, for example
T 1544216831 24<walterbender24>24	and Sugarizer.

T 1544216893 24<walterbender24>24	very little
T 1544216941 24<Quozl24>24	none on Sugar, some metadata fixes for activities, some API changes.
T 1544216951 24<walterbender24>24	To be honest, I got caught by the earlier dates of the program this year. Not a good match with my work schedule.

T 1544217833 24<Quozl24>24	i think for marketing a big problem we have is a web site made by volunteers or students that hasn't been provably successful; i suggested a/b testing in one of my github comments.

T 1544218154 24<walterbender24>24	we should survey the possible platforms... haven't done that in a while...

T 1544219083 29<2125ifeanyi_29>	@walterbender: hinted about the graphics as well, that can immediately discourage interaction on a website (it all falls under content).
T 1544219109 24<Quozl24>24	and we can't just guess what the right content is, it must be tested.

T 1544219147 24<walterbender24>24	randomize where people land?
T 1544219148 24<Quozl24>24	and with random strangers coming to our web site, the only option is a-b testing.

T 1544808755 29<2125aust-n29>	I have noticed that there are very few members of sugar on the #sugar-newbies channel
T 1544808780 29<2125aust-n29>	As a result, there have been some queries by 'newbies' which have been left unanswered / the 'new' contributor leaves due to a lack of activity on the channel.
T 1544808817 29<2125aust-n29>	Might it be a good idea to remove #sugar-newbies and instead point newbies towards this #sugar channel?
