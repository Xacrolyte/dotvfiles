A small planet in the galaxy of awesome dotfiles created with :sparkling_heart: by Vipul Gupta :hatching_chick:. 

I love chicks, it's my Sigil. [Reference](https://mixstersite.wordpress.com/2017/06/26/firstpost-and-chicks/)

## Installation
This really doesn't have a installation procedure. My dotfiles are small in comparison, a normal symlinking script would do. 

Give a try to Homely as well - here's a getting started presentation - [DotPython](https://slides.com/vipulgupta2048/dotpython-3/fullscreen)

## Config Folder
Config folder will now be containing all the files that you would normally find in Config. 

### Fish 
I use this as my default command line shell, hence the dotfiles for Bash may be quite outdated. 
If you are a Fish user, luck and happiness will find you if you take a peek at my dotfiles. 

### Plymouth
I love tweaking, hence once I knew about playing around the bootloader. I couldn't resist. Check out the many custom themes and scripts that I have. This is my bootscreen. Going to write describing how I did it.

### Geany; Atom and Nano
I used Geany, Atom and Nano as my editors, the dotfiles contains everything from keymaps to colorscheme configs.

## HexChat
I have the configuration locked down good for HexChat, check it out. Going to write a blog about it too. 

## VScode
Not much later after the acquistion of GitHub by Microsoft and struggling with Atom. I changed sides to VScode. Oh man, life became way much easier. I got all the best extensions, with all the best color schemes. 

Checkout the folders, [vscode_extension_easyinstall](https://github.com/vipulgupta2048/dotvfiles/tree/master/vscode_extension_easyinstall) and vscode_extensions_gist
