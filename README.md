## Installation
Refer to the dot_script.sh for installation. [Incomplete] 
Not tested yet for other distributions. Will work all flavours of debian. 
Will add more steps later.

## Fish 
I use this as my default command line shell, hence the dotfiles for Bash may be quite outdated. 
If you are a Fish user, luck will find you if you take a peek at my dotfiles. 

## Geany and Atom
I use Geany and Atom as my editors, the dotfiles contains everything from keymaps to colorscheme configs. 

## MIT license

Will add more description soon.
